## Motivation
For making interesting and aesthetic fractal images quickly and easily using Python. The code
was written to be able to generate many different and unique fractals using only a few functions.
The mandelbrot and julia functions take as input the complex valued function that is iterated over
(i.e. many functions, rather than just z^2 + c).

## Current Status
There are functions for Mandelbrot and Julia set generation, image and animation creation. There is
a function for Buddhabrot generation and a function for the "nebula" coloring of the Buddhabrot. Finally,
there is a class for creating and visualizaing 2D random walks (with bias, if desired).

## Usage
See the examples.py module.
